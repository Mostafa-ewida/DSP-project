# My AI Model Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the AI model I've developed for image classification.

## Model Architecture
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with two convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer. The architecture is as follows:

1. Convolutional Layer: 32 filters of size 3x3, ReLU activation
2. Max Pooling Layer: 2x2 pool size
3. Convolutional Layer: 64 filters of size 3x3, ReLU activation
4. Max Pooling Layer: 2x2 pool size
5. Flatten Layer
6. Dense Layer: 64 units, ReLU activation
7. Output Layer: 10 units (for 10 classes)

## Training
The model was trained for 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The training and validation datasets were used for this process.

## Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the training set and Y% on the validation set. The loss values were Z for training and W for validation.

## Visualization
The model's performance was visualized using Matplotlib, showing both accuracy and loss over the epochs. The plots indicate that the model is learning effectively.

## Next Steps
Future work includes fine-tuning the model architecture and hyperparameters to improve performance.
